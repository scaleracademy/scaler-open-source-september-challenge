With GitHub Desktop, you can interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser.
 You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop, such as pushing to, pulling from, 
 and cloning remote repositories, attributing commits, and creating pull requests, with visual confirmation 
 of changes.

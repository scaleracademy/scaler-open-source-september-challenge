### What are Github Project Boards?

GitHub project boards helps you keep track of stuffs you're actively working on within your repository. You can say it's a project managemnet tool, or even a collaboration tool for teams. You create a project board with columns for your TODO or backlogs or even bugs, In progress activies and lastly a column for your finished tasks. You can sort of see it as a SCRUM board.

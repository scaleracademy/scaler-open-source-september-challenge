## Welcome to Challenge 9

This challenge is a two part challenge to cover the concepts of Git Rebase and Git Squash and continuation of the previous challenge which is challenge 8. 



Task: 

1. First, make sure you are on the ``challenge8`` branch as created in the previous challenge. 

2. Create another commit by making some change in the ``your-github-username-3.md`` file and push the change to your forked repository.

3. Now, we will use the concept of Git Rebase to squash the last two commits into one commit.
For this. Review the commits you've made on the challenge8 branch using the git log --oneline command. You should see two commits on the challenge8 branch. Use the interactive rebase command to squash the commits.

4. In the interactive rebase editor, change the word pick to squash (or s) for the commits you want to combine. Save and close the editor. Edit the combined commit message when prompted. Force push the changes to your forked repository. 

5. Take the screenshot of the terminal when you have successfully used the git rebase to squash the commits and post it in the comment created in the first challenge (challenge 1).

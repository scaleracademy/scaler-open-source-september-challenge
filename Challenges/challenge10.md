## Welcome to Challenge 10

Welcome to the 10th challenge! 

Today's let's try to use the concept for Git Rebase you learnt but on a Pull Request.


Task: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Checkout to the branch you created in Challenge 3 in your forked repository. 

<<<<<<< HEAD

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Create another commit by making some change in the markdown file (`<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.md`) you created in Challenge 5 and push the change to your forked repository.

3. Now, we will use the concept of Git Rebase to squash the last two commits into one commit.

4. For this. Review the commits you've made on the branch using the git log --oneline command. You should see a number of commits on the branch. Use the interactive rebase command to squash the commits.

5. In the interactive rebase editor, change the word pick to squash (or s) for the commits you want to combine. Save and close the editor. Edit the combined commit message when prompted. Force push the changes to your forked repository.

6. Check if the commit reflects in the Pull request you created in Challenge 5 in the main challenge repository.

( If it does not, then sync your forked repository with the main repository and push the changes to your forked repository.)

7. Take the screenshot of the terminal when you have successfully used the git rebase to squash the commits and post it in the comment created in the first challenge (challenge 1).

## Task 

Today we will be learning about Git Aliases! :). This is an amazing feature that helps us use less keystroke

Aliases are used to create shorter commands that map to longer commands. Aliases enable more efficient workflows by requiring fewer keystrokes to execute a command. To learn more;

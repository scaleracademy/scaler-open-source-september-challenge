## What is the Scaler Open Source September Challenge?

Every day throughout September, for those who have enrolled, we will share one task. 
Participants will need to use their knowledge of Git and Github for each task, and the difficulty level of the tasks will rise daily.

The primary objective? To help the community become better at contributing to open source and building projects.

## Learning Outcomes
1. Learn how to contribute to open source projects. Learn the basics of creating issues, pull requests, Git and Github
2. Celebrate with new rewards every time you reach a milestone!
